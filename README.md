# Overview
The "Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning Project" enhances the classic game of tic-tac-toe using machine learning techniques. It employs decision tree and random forest classifiers to predict winners, comparing their performances.

## Features
Utilizes machine learning techniques to predict winners in tic-tac-toe games.
Implements decision tree and random forest classifiers for prediction.
Compares the performance of the classifiers based on accuracy and evaluation metrics.

## Dependencies
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn

## File Structure
decision_tree.py: Implementation of the decision tree classifier.
random_forest.py: Implementation of the random forest classifier.
tic_tac_toe_data.csv: Dataset containing tic-tac-toe game data.

## Contribution
